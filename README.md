# C51-4-Bits-electronic-clock

YSZ-4 clock firmware similar to original.
Feel free to use it.

--- Compile using MCU 8051 IDE. ---

By the way, AT89C2051 doesn't require any fuse bits. It has only LOCK bits.
I have no experience with AT89S2051. My programmer doesn't support it.
If you have any suggestions, write me to e-mail pointed below.

Good luck!
